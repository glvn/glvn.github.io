I see you've found my about page.

I'm 14 years old, and I live in the UK. I'm a programmer, about to take computer science for GCSE. I know a number of programming languages, with Ruby being my best (and yes, I know Ruby on Rails).

I'm interested in all things tech, and this is my blog random stuff thingy. It's my little way of pretending people care about what I say :-)

I hope you enjoy the ~~useful~~ useless things I put on here.
