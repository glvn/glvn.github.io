Bitcoin. That evil, scary, illegal currency. At least that's an image the media has created thanks to online drug markets.
In reality, Bitcoin is a wonderful currency with so many uses. It's a great way to donate to places like WikiLeaks without the NSA (or GCHQ) putting you on some terror watchlist. It's a great way to quickly buy things online. It's a great way to buy drugs online, if you're into that sort of thing.

You get the point. Bitcoin is incredibly useful. I'm 14, and I recently purchased my first Bitcoins after trying to get some for months, and months, and months. If you're under 18, or even over 18, buying Bitcoins can be very difficult. But the chances are, if you're over 18 you can get them if you dig up a few documents or take a visit to your bank. But if you're under 18, like me, there's some problems...

 - Many banks, particularly in the UK, don't let under 18s (or sometimes under 16s) purchase Bitcoins
 - Depending on your age, meeting up with a stranger on LocalBitcoins probably isn't a good idea...
 - Most exchanges require you to be over 18
 - Almost all exchanges require ID, and if you're under 18 you're very limited in what ID can be submitted. In my case, I had only my passport, and a lot of exchanges needed more than that

I could probably go on longer, but I've made my point - it's difficult to get Bitcoins if you're under 18. But it's possible, if you look hard enough. And after my experience getting some Bitcoins, I'm going to share that with you.

## LocalBitcoins - Cash by mail ##
Most people probably see this and think *'sending cash in the post? You must be mad! You should never send large amounts of cash in the post.'* And you'd probably be right, there is a VERY small chance of losing the money in the postal system, but it could happen. Even so, the fact that it's so uncommon makes it very unlikely.

Click [here](https://localbitcoins.com/instant-bitcoins/?quick-action=buy&quick-amount=&quick-currency=GBP&quick-online_provider=CASH_BY_MAIL&quick-country_code=GB&find-offers=) to see cash by mail options in the UK. The rates are usually decent for this, and sellers rarely care about trading history if you're buying in cash, so anyone can get it!

## Paxful.com - Buying something for someone else ##
This is how I purchased my Bitcoins, and how I'll probably get them in the future. This site has many options, including bank transfers and paying with PayPal. We're going to be looking at 2 - paying with PayPal directly, and buying gift cards for people.

The rates are ok when you pay with PayPal, but not fantastic. You're going to pay extra due to PayPal being risky for the seller. Just register [here](http://paxful.com) and then buy some [here](https://paxful.com/buy-bitcoin/paypal). Make sure you look at a seller's feedback first to make sure it isn't a scam. The sellers are usually very friendly, and will explain everything to you.

Now onto buying Bitcoins with gift cards...
If you go [here](https://paxful.com/buy-bitcoin), there's four options in boxes for how to buy Bitcoins (there's far more than that, but these are the only ones in boxes). The far left box is about buying Bitcoins with gift cards, and there it lists specific gift cards you can buy Bitcoins with. The rates for these are VERY high, and you're going to pay around double the price of bitcoins elsewhere. However, it's still an option if you can't do anything else. Just find a seller who wants giftcards, start the trade and they'll explain what to do. The good thing about this is you don't need PayPal - many of the sites that sell the gift cards accept debit cards, credit cards (you could borrow your parent's), PayPal and sometimes other options too. Just buy the gift card with the correct amount, then give the seller the code. They'll explain everything for you, so don't worry :-).

## SatoshiPoint ##
This was suggested by [/u/alistairmilne](https://www.reddit.com/user/alistairmilne) on reddit, so feel free to thank him! They operate the largest network of Bitcoin ATMs, and are very reliable (and have good rates!). They're actually setting up a lot more in London this week, so if you live near there (and your parents would let you go to your nearest one, or drive you to one if you're further away) this is a GREAT method of purchasing Bitcoins!

Their current locations are in London, Bristol, Swansea and Manchester, and they're often adding more locations. You can view a map [here](https://satoshipoint.com/). You'll need a wallet ready when you go to one of these, so make sure you create one before you go (if you don't know how, you can find one of the many hundreds of tutorials online explaining it). You'll also need to bring some cash to the ATM, as they don't accept cards. This also happens to be a great way of selling Bitcoins too, as the ATM can give you a QR code to send Bitcoins to, and then print out a ticket to redeem cash with within 10 minutes.

You can also see some other ATMs [here](http://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-atm-map/), but this map isn't updated regularly.

## ATOMBIT iOS Wallet ##
**Note: I have not tested this. I am writing this based on a comment on reddit.**
[/u/ATOMBITwallet](https://www.reddit.com/user/ATOMBITwallet) suggested that I use their iOS app to purchase Bitcoins. They say that, if you have a verified PayPal account, you can purchase up to $100 (Â£64) of Bitcoin every 24 hours. You have to have an iOS device though, as this app is not currently available for other devices.

I can only assume that it also works in the UK, as most things do with PayPal, however I'm not sure. If anyone has tried this before or tries it, please let me know and I'll update the post.

----------
So there you have it: 4 handy methods of buying bitcoins in the UK (if you're in the US, some of these will work there too) for under 18s. I hope this guide is useful for some people, and not just read by a few people and lost forever. If you have any more methods, let me know and I'll add them on.

Now you can purchase all the Bitcoins you want :-)
